Questions, questions...

**How do I use the bot?**

After the bot has been added to the server using [this link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=310050883100737536&scope=bot&permissions=27648), you can access the commands using $ prefix. Type $help for list of all commands. Server admins can change the prefix to something else using $prefix

**How do I setup game update notifications?**

First, you must have the "manage server" permission. Provided you have that, first point the bot to the channel where it'll post announcements, using $updatenotifier channel #<channel>. After that, enable it using $updatenotifier toggle on. Make sure the bot has permissions to talk in that channel.

**Does the bot work in DMs?**

Yes. API keys are cross-server too, if you're in multiple servers with the bot.
